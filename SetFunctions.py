'''Here we have to define two set variables and we have to perform different set operations:
union, intersection, difference and symmetric difference.'''
A = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} # Set A
B = {2,4,6} #Set B
print("Union of A and B is ",A.union(B))

print("Difference of A and B is ",A.difference(B))
print("Symmetric difference of A and B is ",A.symmetric_difference(B))
